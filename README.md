## About this branch

I made this branch because the original repo was inactive and missing things I needed to make the ComfyUI usable. Also, many other custom nodes bundle unrelated features together or search the internet without asking for permission.

## Branch Improvements

- Search models in models tab.
- Advanced keyword search using `"multiple words in quotes"` or a minus sign to `-exclude`.
- Search `/`subdirectories of main directory based on your file structure (for example, `/1.5/styles`).
- Include models listed in `extra_model_paths.yaml`.
- Increased supported preview image types.
- Correctly change colors using ComfyUI's theme colors.
- Simplified UI.

## TODO

### One-click to add a model/node to workspace

- &#9744; Copy icon `ðŸ“‹` or plus icon `+`?
- &#9744; Sidebar mode
  - &#9744; Drag to add?

### Downloading tab

- &#9744; Replace Install tab with Downloading tab (more practical IMO).
- &#9744; Download a model from a url.
- &#9744; Choose save path in browser.

### Search filtering and sort

- &#9744; Add auto-suggest paths in search
- &#9744; Filters dropdown
  - &#9744; Stable Diffusion model version/Clip/Upscale/?
  - &#9744; Favorites
- &#9744; Sort-by dropdown
  - &#9744; Date modified (ascending/decending)
  - &#9744; Date created (ascending/decending)
  - &#9744; Recently used (ascending/decending)
  - &#9744; Frequently used (ascending/decending)
- &#9744; `or` vs `and` search keywords (currently `and`)

### Settings

- &#9744; Exclude hidden folders with a `.` prefix.
- &#9744; Include a optional string to always add to searches.
- &#9744; Enable optional checksum to detect if a model is already downloaded.
- &#9744; Add `settings.yaml` and add file to `.gitignore`.

### Model info window/panel (server load/send on demand)

- &#9744; Info icon `â“˜`
- &#9744; Optional (re)download `ðŸ“¥ï¸Ž`model info from the internet and cache the text file locally. (requires checksum enabled)
- &#9744; Delete model with warning popup.

### Image preview

- &#9744; Support multiple preview images (swipe?).
- &#9744; Show preview images for videos.
  - &#9744; If ffmpeg or cv2 available, extract the first frame of the video and use as image preview.
  - &#9744; Play preview video?
