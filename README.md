## About this fork

I made this fork because the original repo was inactive and missing many things I needed to make the ComfyUI usable. Also, many other custom nodes bundle unrelated features together or search the internet in the background.

Currently it is still missing some features it should have.

## Fork Improvements

- Search models in models tab.
- Advanced keyword search using `"multiple words in quotes"` or a minus sign to `-exclude`.
- Search `/`subdirectories of model directories based on your file structure (for example, `/styles/clothing`).
- Include models listed in ComfyUI's `extra_model_paths.yaml`.
- Button to copy a model to the ComfyUI clipboard. (Embedding cannot be copied to the system clipboard with an http connection.)
- Right, left and bottom toggleable sidebar modes.
- Drag model to graph to add or existing node to set model.
- Drag embedding to textarea to append.
- Increased supported preview image types.
- Correctly change colors using ComfyUI's theme colors.
- Simplified UI.

### Downloading tab

- &#9744; Replace Install tab with Downloading tab (more practical IMO).
